### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Assistant Professor in Engineering at Northeastern University. I have taught computer science, statistics, applied mathematics, programming, 3D visual effects, web programming, server administration, networking, and game programming at Northeastern University, UCLA, Santa Monica College, ITT, and the Art Institutes - Hollywood. My PhD was in computer science from UCLA. My major field was computational, and systems biology and my minor fields were artificial intelligence and statistics.

I also have a Masters in Information Design and Data Visualization from Northeastern University and I'm currently enrolled in a Part-Time MS in Finance/MBA at Northeastern University.

My research, consulting  and teaching revolve around math, AI, ML, RL, DL, Visualization, Computational Biology, and Games.  

I also do Angel advising. This means that I act as a consultant and advisor for issues related to Analytics, AI, ML, RL, DL, Visualization, Computational Biology, and Games for early start-ups in exchange for equity.  New tech start-ups rarely have the time or money to make mistakes related to machine learning and AI technology. Understanding AI in 2021 is critical and far more techincal than creating a website. All entrepreneurs should understand what they don't know and get advice related to it if it is important to their company.

I do not invest cash in start-ups, only time, and I do it in exchange for equity as early start-ups are usually very cash strapped.

I also have a company, Fatweasel Digital, the builds AI software for early start-ups for a mix of cash and equity. I call this "AI Ghostwriting."   

Having workable proof of concept prototypes is critical for attracting funding for a start-up.
