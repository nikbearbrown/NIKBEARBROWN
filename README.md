### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Assistant Professor in Engineering.

My research, consulting  and teaching revolve around math, AI, ML, RL, DL, Visualization, Computational Biology, and Games.  

This site is an AI and Visualization journal.  When I come across something interesting I blog about it.  This is mostly for me so I can follow up on interesting ideas and they don't get lost in old emails.  

I also do Angel advising. This means that I act as a consultant and advisor for issues related to Analytics, AI, ML, RL, DL, Visualization, Computational Biology, and Games for early start-ups in exchange for equity.  
New tech start-ups rarely have the time or money to make mistakes related to machine learning and AI technology.   

I do not invest cash in start-ups, only time, and I do it in exchange for equity as early start-ups are usually very cash strapped.

I also have a company, Fatweasel Digital, the builds AI software for early start-ups for a mix of cash and equity. I call this "AI Ghostwriting."   

Having workable proof of concept prototypes is critical for attracting funding for a start-up.
