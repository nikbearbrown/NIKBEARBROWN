Subject: Request for Registration Assistance – FINA 6206 Finance Seminar

Dear [Advisor's Name],

I hope you are well. I have completed FINA 6203 - Investment Analysis (Fall 2024, Grade A) and am currently registered for the remaining required courses to complete my MSFMBA. However, I am unable to register for FINA 6206 - Finance Seminar due to a prerequisite hold, despite having satisfied the requirements. As FINA 6206 is a core requirement for graduation according to the 2024–2025 catalog, can you please assist in lifting the hold or manually enrolling me? I plan to complete my degree by Fall 2025.

Thank you for your assistance,

[Your Name]  
[Your NUID if applicable]
