# Who am I?

**Nik Bear Brown ("Professor Bear")**

I am an Associate Teaching Professor at Northeastern University's College of Engineering with expertise in AI, machine learning, and computational biology. With a PhD in Computer Science from UCLA and additional degrees in Finance, MBA, Information Design and Visualization, and Biochemistry, I bring multidisciplinary perspectives to education and research.

I've taught at prestigious institutions including Northeastern University, UCLA, Santa Monica College, Arts Institutes, and LA Film School, specializing in AI engineering, machine learning, game development, algorithms, and data science. As founder of Humanitarians AI and a mentor at AI Skunkworks, I'm dedicated to developing ethical AI solutions and preparing the next generation of AI engineers.

## Core Principles

### Active Engagement Over Passive Consumption
Do it.

### AI-Enhanced Personalized Learning
We have an AI Fluency framework called "Botspeak" that teaches people to effectively and ethically leverage AI.

### Real-World Problem Solving
Abstract concepts become concrete when applied to meaningful problems.
My courses, and non-profit incorporate industry-relevant challenges, social impact projects, and research.

### Collaborative Innovation
The most significant technological advancements rarely come from individuals working in isolation.
Teach those who are coming after you.

### Ethical AI Development
Technical skills must be paired with ethical judgment.
